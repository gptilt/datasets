## Dataset Details

This dataset contains **{{ pretty_name }}**. It was collected and processed via the official Riot Games API as part of the GPTilt project. The primary goals are to democratize access to high-quality LoL data for research and analysis, and to foster public exploration into game dynamics using data-driven methods.

The data is structured into a single **enriched events table**:

* **events**: Contains a **detailed timeline** of enriched in-game events (e.g., `CHAMPION_KILL`, `ITEM_PURCHASED`, `WARD_PLACED`, `BUILDING_KILL`, `ELITE_MONSTER_KILL`) with timestamps, and contextual information regarding both game state (player positions (where applicable), inventories, and levels) and pregame state (champions, runes, etc).

### Curation Rationale

This dataset was created to address the lack of large-scale, publicly available, and analysis-ready datasets for League of Legends research. The GPTilt project aims to provide resources for the community to apply data science and AI techniques to better understand the intricate dynamics of the game, moving beyond simple win prediction towards interpreting strategic patterns and complex interactions. This specific dataset focuses on high-elo (Challenger) players to capture refined strategic execution.

### Source Data

#### Data Collection and Processing

The source data originates exclusively from the [**Riot Games API**](https://developer.riotgames.com/apis) and [**CDragon**](https://communitydragon.org/).

1. **Seeding:** High-elo player PUUIDs were initially identified using the `league-v4` endpoint for the Challenger tier across multiple regions.
2. **Match History:** The `match-v5` endpoint was used to retrieve recent match IDs for these players.
3. **Match & Timeline Fetching:** The `match-v5` (match details) and `match-v5` (match timeline) endpoints were used to download the full data for each unique match ID identified.
4. **Raw Storage:** Raw API responses (JSON format) were saved.
5. **Staging & Transformation:** Raw data was parsed, and transformed into the basic-tier dataset 'League of Legends Challenger Matches'. The matches dataset was then used to build the enriched events dataset.
6. **Output:** Data was written to Parquet files.

#### Who are the source data producers?

The underlying gameplay data is generated by **League of Legends players** participating in high-elo ranked matches. The **Riot Games API** serves as the source interface providing access to this gameplay data. The dataset curators are the contributors to the GPTilt project who performed the collection and processing steps. No demographic information about the players is collected, besides the region.

#### Personal and Sensitive Information

The dataset contains **PUUIDs** and **Participant IDs**, which are pseudonymous identifiers linked to League of Legends accounts. No other Personally Identifiable Information (PII) like real names, emails, or addresses is included. Use of these identifiers is subject to Riot Games' policies. Users should exercise caution and adhere to these policies, avoiding attempts to [deanonymize players who cannot reasonably be identified from visible information](https://developer.riotgames.com/policies/general#_developer-safety).

### Bias, Risks, and Limitations

* **Skill Tier Bias:** This dataset focuses *exclusively* on the Challenger tier. Findings may not generalize to other skill levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, Grandmaster) where metas, champion picks, and strategic execution differ significantly. Because match data is selected by searching for Challenger players, multi-tier games may (and are expected) to be present in the dataset.
* **Regional Bias:** While collected from multiple regions, the distribution might not be perfectly balanced, potentially reflecting the metas dominant in the included regions during the collection period.
* **Patch Bias:** The data reflects gameplay on specific game versions (see `matches` table `gameVersion` field). Major patches can significantly alter champion balance, items, and objectives, potentially making findings less relevant to different patches.
* **Missing Context:** The data captures *recorded* events and states but lacks external context like player communication (voice/text chat), player fatigue/tilt, real-time strategic intent, or external distractions.
* **API Limitations:** Data is subject to the accuracy and granularity provided by the Riot Games API. Some nuanced actions or states might not be perfectly captured. Rate limits inherent to the API restrict the size and frequency of potential dataset updates.

#### Recommendations

* Users should explicitly acknowledge the **high-elo (Challenger) bias** when reporting results and be cautious about generalizing findings to other player segments.
* Always consider the **game version (`gameVersion`)** when analyzing the data, as metas and balance change significantly between patches.
* Users **must** adhere to the **Riot Games API Terms of Service and Developer Policies** in all uses of this data.
